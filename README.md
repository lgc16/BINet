BINet: learn to solve partial differential equations with boundary integral networks

Remark. The difference between the return of pedaldomain and polygondomain in domainsetting is that polygondomain's normal and h are only on each side, while the return of pedaldomain is point by point. After that, polygondomain's normal and h will be modified.
